# TodoList
This is a web application which helps you keep track of all your activities to improve productivity
You can do the following:
- add a todo item
- mark an item as done
- and delete an item. 
Also, you can clear your list when all done. I developed this app using HTML, CSS and JS.

Note: The items displayed in the app, do not delete when the page is reloaded. They are only deleted when the refresh icon within the app is clicked.
